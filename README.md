# DigitClassifier
A drawing application that classifies digits in real time using machine learning.
The drawing application is implemented using the Python library TkInter.

The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.

## Required libraries
* TensorFlow
* TkInter
* Pillow (PIL)
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* SciPy


## Instructions
Run main.py to start the application.
The model is trained and saved in model.h5. The model is automatically loaded once main.py runs.
To re-train the model, run model.py

## Known bugs
*None*
